 # README

This is a production test with code from julien Lamalle.

This web application is an application that showcases events created by users that we generated in our database initially.

To create a new event, you have to be logged_in : To log in, you can create your account  ;)

To see an event's details, you should also be logged in ;)

The used version of Ruby is 2.5.1, for Rails we used version 5.2.4.3

If your versions are different, you can use the command :

rm gemfile.lock

To launch the project on your local server, consider making a

```
bundle install
```
```
rails db:seed
```
```
rails s
```
